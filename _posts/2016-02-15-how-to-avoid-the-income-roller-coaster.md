Why is it that some agents seem to have discipline around the daily focus on lead generation for their businesses and yet, the majority of agents struggle with this practice?

If you resonate with this dilemma, you are not alone!

Agents often feel like they are failing because of their inability to stay on top of lead generation. 

There's good news though! 

You see, it's really all about **habits.**

_Your _habits.

Making lead generation 

_habitual_

is the key to constant business.

And because beliefs drive habits, let's look first at the beliefs that 

prevent

lead generation from becoming a habit.

Most agents can list several beliefs they have around 

_why they don't lead generate_

.

Here's the most common _passionately _delivered list:

**_I don't want to bother people._**

**_I don't want people to think I am using them for business._**

**_I don't like rejection.(Who does?)_**

**_I never get any leads._**

**_I don't know who to call._**

**_I don't want to call people I know._**

**_I don't want to call people I don't know._**

**_It feels like a waste of time._**

Wow!

So the 

**stories that agents tell themselves**

are powerful. 

Let's look at the counterarguments of top agents just for fun:

I don't want to bother people.

**_Is it not expected that salespeople are to reach out to sell? Great        salespeople sell. _**

I don't want people to think I am using them for business.

**_I want people to think of me when they have real estate needs or referrals!_**

I don't like rejection.

**_People like me.They need my services._**

I never get any leads.

**_We get leads by talking to people._**

I don't know who to call.

**_Here's a phone book.Call anybody. Find someone who needs help._**

I don't want to call people I know.

**_If I don't call people I know and ask they if they need help, someone else will call them. Also, I want to be sure that the people I know see me in action, selling. I want them to know how hard I work._**

I don't want to call people I don't know.

**_To be a real estate agent, you need to talk to somebody. _**

It feels like a waste of time.

**_You are in the business of serving people. Talk to them. _**

Top agents have often arrived at a point where lead generation has truly become simpler and not even slightly scary because their belief systems reflect thoughts like in the above counterarguments.

And as a result, 

**top agents have learned how to approach lead generation from an empowering standpoint, making it routine.They believe they need to connect with people regularly! **

So if we can persuade an agent to adopt empowering beliefs such as 

_you are here to find the people who need your help_

, then we can get to the real holdback: 

**the habitual routine.**

**If you desire a different outcome, then you must do things differently.**

It really is that obvious.

And the good news is that we can design a new routine!

A routine is needed to turn lead generation into a sequence of enjoyable habits.

And these habits need to be 

**_consciously decided_**

and 

**_laid out to create a system_**

that sends you into a 

**peak state of engagement.**

Well, that sounds complicated and yet, it's simple.
